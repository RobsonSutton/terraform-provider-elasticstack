# Resource: elasticstack_elasticsearch_logstash_pipeline

Creates or updates centrally managed logstash pipelines. See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/logstash-apis.html

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "elasticstack" {
  elasticsearch {}
}

resource "elasticstack_elasticsearch_logstash_pipeline" "example" {
  pipeline_id = "test_pipeline"
  description = "This is an example pipeline"

  pipeline = <<-EOF
  input{}
  filter{}
  output{}
EOF

  pipeline_metadata = {
    "type"    = "logstash_pipeline"
    "version" = 1
  }

  pipeline_batch_delay    = 100
  pipeline_batch_size     = 250
  pipeline_workers        = 2
  queue_checkpoint_writes = 2048
  queue_max_bytes_number  = 2
  queue_max_bytes_units   = "mb"
  queue_type              = "persisted"
}

output "pipeline" {
  value = elasticstack_elasticsearch_logstash_pipeline.example.pipeline_id
}
```

- **pipeline_id** (String) Identifier for the pipeline.

### Optional

- **description** (String) Description of the pipeline.
- **elasticsearch_connection** (Block List, Max: 1) Used to establish connection to Elasticsearch server. Overrides environment variables if present. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--elasticsearch_connection))
- **pipeline_batch_delay** (Number) Time in milliseconds to wait for each event before sending an undersized batch to pipeline workers.
- **pipeline_batch_size** (Number) The maximum number of events an individual worker thread collects before executing filters and outputs.
- **pipeline_metadata** (Map of String) Optional metadata about the pipeline.
- **pipeline_workers** (Number) The number of parallel workers used to run the filter and output stages of the pipeline.
- **queue_checkpoint_writes** (Number) The maximum number of events written before a checkpoint is forced when persistent queues are enabled.
- **queue_max_bytes_number** (Number) The total capacity of the queue when persistent queues are enabled.
- **queue_max_bytes_units** (String) Units for the total capacity of the queue when persistent queues are enabled.
- **queue_type** (String) The internal queueing model for event buffering. Options are memory for in-memory queueing, or persisted for disk-based acknowledged queueing.
- **username** (String) User who last updated the pipeline.

### Read-Only

- **id** (String) Internal identifier of the resource
- **last_modified** (String) Date the pipeline was last updated.
